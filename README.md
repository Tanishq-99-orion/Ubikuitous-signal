# Ubikuitous-signal
This project asks a simple question: when a protein is ubiquitinated, what cellular process does it drive? By combining linkage prediction, E2–E3 context, substrate features, DUB activity, cell state, and cell-type priors, the pipeline infers whether ubiquitination leads to proteasomal degradation, lysosomal, autophagy, recycling or signaling.
